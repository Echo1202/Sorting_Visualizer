# Sorting Visualizer

A simple sorting algorithm visualizer using the PyQt5 library. Made as a personal study on data structures, sorting algorithms, and making my own UI from scratch without using 
any external tools. I also used this project as a way to understand time complexity of each sorting algorithm as well as space complexity for data structures being used in this 
project.

# Features

- Dynamically add and remove data points
- Color coding to show which data points are being sorted within the algorithm 
- Can reset data points using a free moving slider 
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort
